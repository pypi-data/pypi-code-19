Draws Allsky Nightsky Images with stars from the GAIA catalog

    This work has made use of data from the European Space Agency (ESA)
    mission {\\it Gaia} (\\url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia}), processed by
    the {\\it Gaia} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC,
    \\url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium}). Funding
    for the DPAC has been provided by national institutions, in particular
    the institutions participating in the {\\it Gaia} Multilateral Agreement.
